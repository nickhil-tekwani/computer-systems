The primary workings of the code are explained in practicum.c main function. Double.h implements a FIFO queue using a
doubly linked list.

This project was built in clion, if you load everything in and point CMakeLists.txt as your make file, you can run the debugger and see the output in terminal.

For compilation not in Clion, you can simply gcc with doubly.h and practicum.c
Due to machine constraints, this has not been thoroughly tested. Please reach out to me if there are any issues.
